# code-in-place-2020
Final Project for Stanford's Code in Place

Using an excel sheet that lists celebrity June birthdays, this program creates a dictionary to which birthdays can be added or deleted from. 
The program prints how old each person in the final dictionary will be this year, as well as create a birthday calendar using tkinter.
